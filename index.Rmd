***Welcome to the Carlson Lab's OceanR workgroup for learning to use R for your oceanographic research. We will be meeting semi-regularly to help you get acquainted with using R and the wide area of things that it can do for you.***  

R is an incredibly versatile programing environment and people use it for a variety of applications. This website was even created with it! Our focus will be on developing the skills to integrate R into our own research analyses. We will be using real data whenever possible to help learn how to solve the problems that may come up along the way.   
<br>  
Just like life, coding in R becomes easier the more you practice and there are many ways to reach your goal. This is intended to be a working group, not a lecture; it will be a collaborative effort, so be prepared to interact. None of us are experts and we all have a lot that we can learn from each other. Most of all, keep an open mind and have some fun with it!
