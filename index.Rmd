### Welcome to the Carlson Lab's OceanR workgroup for learning to use R for your oceanographic research. We will be meeting semi-regularly to help you get acquainted with using R and explore the wide range of things that it can do for you.

R is an incredibly versatile programing environment and people use it for a variety of applications. This website was even created with it! Our focus will be on developing the skills to integrate R into our own research analyses. We will be using real data whenever possible to help learn how to solve the problems that may come up along the way.   

Just like life, coding in R becomes easier the more you practice and there are many ways to reach your goal. This is intended to be a working group, not a lecture; it will be a collaborative effort, so be prepared to interact. None of us are experts and we all have a lot that we can learn from each other. Most of all, keep an open mind and have some fun with it!
